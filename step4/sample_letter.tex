\opening{Dear Recruiter,}

My name is Iulius Caesar and I am a senior Java and C++ programmer and architect at Initech. The company is experiencing a difficult period and a time for new challenges has come. Actually I don't give a darn about challenges: I just want to earn more money while doing less.

I am bla bla bla... and a good team player. Well, not really! I like to be assigned tasks I find interesting enough for me to tackle, \textit{without teammates getting in my way}. I am a jerk and I want to be left alone. I will come up with sound solutions that I won't explain to others nor document. I will be unmanageable, proud, lazy and sexist\footnote{The good thing of mantaining a technical blog is that there will be no women here complaining.}. I will desert meetings and bitch and moan about my managers, whom I despise from the bottom of my heart because the majority of them are useless. In brief, I will be an outstanding programmer for your company. 

\closing{Regards}
